Remote Support Tool 1.1.1
=========================

*Remote Support Tool* is an easy single click solution for remote maintenance.

This project started initially as a [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) launcher inspired by [UltraVNC Single Click](http://www.uvnc.com/products/uvnc-sc.html) and [Gitso](https://code.google.com/p/gitso/). For a more consistent platform support and better compatibility the software was completely rewritten in Java and the requirement of any third party VNC software was dropped.

*Remote Support Tool* provides a graphical interface for both sides of a remote support session:

-   *Customer Support Tool* is started by the customer, who likes to provide access on his desktop for a support staff.

-   *Staff Support Tool* is started by the support staff in order to access the customers desktop remotely. 

Because both sides of a support session are covered by *Remote Support Tool*, the software uses its own protocol for communication between customer and staff. The application is currently **not compatible with other VNC based software**.
